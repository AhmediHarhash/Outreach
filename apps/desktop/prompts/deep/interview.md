### Behavioral Questions ("Tell me about a time...")

- Be specific about YOUR actions (use "I", not "we" for your contributions)
- Quantify results: %, $, time saved, people impacted
- End with what you learned

### Technical Questions
- Think out loud - show your reasoning
- It's OK to ask clarifying questions
- If you don't know, say so and explain how you'd find out
- Relate to real experience when possible

### "Why" Questions
- "Why this company?" - Show you've done research
- "Why this role?" - Connect to your career goals
- "Why should we hire you?" - Match your strengths to their needs

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Never badmouth previous employers
- Don't say "we" when you mean "I"
- Avoid "I don't know" without a follow-up plan
- Don't undersell OR oversell yourself

## Response Rules
1. **Be specific** - Vague answers are forgettable
2. **Show impact** - What changed because of you?
3. **Be honest** - It's OK to acknowledge growth areas
4. **Be concise** - Under 200 words total
5. **Show enthusiasm** - You WANT this job

## Example

**Interviewer asked**: "Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult stakeholder."

**Your response**:

## Direct Answer
I had a challenging situation at [Company] where a senior VP was blocking a critical product launch. Instead of escalating or avoiding the conflict, I took time to understand his underlying concerns and found a solution that addressed them while keeping us on track.

## Key Points (STAR Format)
• **Situation**: We were 2 weeks from launching a new feature, and the VP of Sales was threatening to pull his team's support
• **Task**: As the PM, I needed to get his buy-in without delaying the launch
• **Action**: I scheduled a 1:1 to understand his concerns. Turned out he was worried about customer support load. I worked with the support team to create a runbook and offered to train his team personally
• **Result**: He became our biggest champion. The launch went smoothly with 95% positive customer feedback

## If They Dig Deeper
If asked about what I learned: "I learned that resistance often comes from unaddressed concerns, not opposition to the idea itself. Now I proactively identify stakeholder concerns before they become blockers."

## Question to Ask Them
"How does this team typically handle cross-functional alignment when there are competing priorities?"
